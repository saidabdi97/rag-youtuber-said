# Course structure for Azure two weeks course

[00:00:00] Hello and welcome to this course on Azure short course. So this is a very short course, two weeks. I plan for this one., In this video, I'll talk about the structure of this course and how that will be built. ~~So we'll go into the slides where I'll show you the structure.~~

So we'll go into, the GitHub repository where you'll find each lecture structure there and you'll see a short plan on how it looks like. So this will be fun. And let's move on to the slides.

**Kokchun Giang-1:** So here I am in the slides, how this Asher two weeks course is structured so everything can be found in the course GitHub repository. It will look like this. I'll show you the GitHub repository soon. But first you can see that we have here, this is different folders and inside each folders there exist different files.

So usually there's a read me. And inside the Read Me, you'll find the video. So for example, here you'll find a video where you can [00:01:00] watch and learn code along and or work along. So it's could be like theory part section, or it could also be a practical video. And then there's usually some slides.

So you can see here, for example here, cloud computing intro pdf. So this is. The slides accompanied this video ~~and ~~and this lecture. And then you will have, here you can see the videos are found in Remi on each lecture. And there's exercises as well. So these exercises in this course will more be theoretical rather than, we might have some practical as well.

However, mostly theoretical, and this is because this is very short course and will focus more on the lab so that the for the people that are enrolled in this class, you will have a lab as well. While. And those that are just following me online won't have the lab, [00:02:00] unfortunately. But that, that's why there isn't so many exercises.

And also this is a very short course to find more exercises and learn more about Azure. We also, I also have a. Longer course, which is around six weeks. But that is more focused on big data and cloud also. So it's it's Azure, but it's also some focus on big data so that so you know that but here you can see there's not so many exercises.

And also the labs, as I said before, they're only for those that are enrolled in this course Okay. That are studying with me live. Yes, it's a short talk about the tech stack. What are we using in this course? Vision Studio Code for the IDE. So we'll use that for some simple development in react is basically just taking getting started with React and then we'll use that.

For deployment later on. Okay. We'll work with the Bash, [00:03:00] CLI so that the terminal is very important. And then we'll work with git Bash and version control locally, and we'll have GitHub as well. So storing the git repositories and version control on Gith. And then we'll have, as I said before, we have React.

So this is just to demonstrate a web a web application so that you create a web application, you can create your own. But if you just follow along, I will just make the Hello World example and use that one for deployment. So we'll make a very simple web app. This is just a Hello World example, and then we'll use.

Docker to dockerize this one. So you can containerize the application and you can go in. So the simple web app, you containerize this application and then we go into the main part, which is Azure. And in Azure we work with Azure Container Registry so that you can deploy this. ~~Contain you, ~~you deploy this [00:04:00] container application into Azure Container Registry, and this you can deploy later on to Azure Web app or apps, Azure App Services, and also we'll show you how to go from react to app services directly.

But it's good to learn how to containerize the application as well. So this is a later lecture. So I think the fifth one or something. And then we have cloud. We will also talk about cloud computing, of course. So there's some, a lot of theory about cloud computing and Azure. And~~ why that ~~why we should move on to the cloud and not just develop locally.

We'll talk about Azure functions and this is an extra lecture, ~~which, ~~which we use Azure functions for serverless computing. I think it's a little bit too short to maybe cover it, so it's, I put it as an extra lecture so you can take a look into it if you have time over. And we'll talk about virtual machines.

So very [00:05:00] basic resource in Azure. And of course when we're talking about resources, we'll go into the portal. We'll talk about resources, resource group, et cetera. So there's a lot of things that we'll navigate around in the portal as well. So this is basically the. Stack I think in Azure functions, maybe we have also like a fasta, API application that we're deploying.

But so there's also some python, but this is also optional. Yes. And some note about how you should study. A few study technique tips here is that you have. The overview you have the ~~Glo, some ~~glossary inside of the exercise. This is good to do in beforehand so that you get some priming of what you're supposed to learn, and then you go into the video, you watch it, you pause and code along or pause and just.

Work along or pause and write down notes. Based on the theory you type out the code, don't copy paste, and you can watch it several times, of course. And [00:06:00] do this before the class if you are studying with me live. And then in the class, you can always discuss with your classmates so that you have multimodal learning and social learning.

And then you bring the questions to class and ask the teacher, ask me or ask the classmates. And then also we have some practical exercises. So go back into the video check with LLM, check resources that I've added and~~ and make may ~~do these practical ~~exercise ~~exercises and the theoretical exercises so that you learn more.

And note that in this course we are not exercise. It's not so exercise heavy. However, ~~as ~~the exercises that are there, it's good to do. And also it's good to do the lab to work more on the lab since it's quite short course. ~~Okay. ~~And also I've linked some resources and these are good to just skim through.

Okay. So let's move on to the GitHub repository and I'll show you the structure over there.

**Kokchun Giang-2:** So when you come into the repository, ~~it ~~it [00:07:00] looks like this Azure short course I've called it. And here you can see there's different sections here. So for example, ~~you go into you, ~~you can ~~go ~~scroll down here and you can see. This is the content of the course. So we have these different parts that we're talking about in the course.

So it's a short course planning and this will be updated as well if needed. And also ~~in, ~~in here you can see different folders. You can go into zero, zero intro, and you can see there's a link to a video here, which you can click on ~~if you click on this one. ~~And you will come into YouTube, which you can watch.

So it's good to watch this video before you come to class. So here you can see this is the video and also the accompanying slides is here. So we can see here cloud computing intro pdf, and the slides. You can watch directly in GitHub, but you can also download it if you want. Then you'll get a PDF file.

And here you can see, you can scroll here and you can see what we're going [00:08:00] through. Yes. And also ~~so ~~it's theoretical, but for example, you come into Azure Fundamentals and here it's divided where you have like theory part if needed, and then there is a, ~~a. Portal ~~practical. So there's a practical part as well.

So if you click on this one and then we will show, I'll show you how you can go into different places in the portal so you can follow along live if you follow along in the video if you want. So that is what I wanted to show you. And also I hope that you can follow along with this structure here.

So in this video we have gone through some basic structure of this course. ~~So that we've ~~gone into the tech stack as well. We have gone into the GitHub repository, showed you where you could find the videos. In the GitHub repository we have showed you ~~how. ~~Where you can find different materials.

And I hope that this made it clear ~~and ~~and see you in this course and [00:09:00] hope that you have fun and learn a lot. So thank you. Bye.
