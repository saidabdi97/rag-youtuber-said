# data processing course structure

**Kokchun:** [00:00:00] Hello and welcome to this lecture where we'll go into how this data processing course is structured. And this is the first part of two parts, where the first part will go into some theory about the github repository and how some study techniques, tech stack. And some more,~~ uh,~~ while in the next lecture, we'll actually go into the GitHub repository and navigate there so that you can see how the course is structured, where you'll find the different,~~ uh,~~ materials,~~ uh,~~ for you to learn.

So moving on to Keynote here, how this data processing course is structured. So everything can be found in the course GitHub repository, as I mentioned. So here you can see this is the main content in GitHub repository. And so this is the course repository, and you can see here that we have several, lectures.

So [00:01:00] 00 is introduction. It's, where we have slides and, you probably watched the video before about the introduction. And then 01 is the core structure, which is this one, and here you'll also have a readme, which describes a little bit more details on, this structure.

So each lecture, there's a readme and there's also a code if available. ~~Uh, ~~and ~~uh, in, ~~in the Read Me, there's,~~ uh,~~ video links. So this is a link to a,~~ uh,~~ a,~~ uh,~~ video and you can see that,~~ uh,~~ you see me here. ~~Uh, ~~and it's a code alongs video. So if you see,~~ uh,~~ that I am parked there and looks like I'm coding, then it's a code alongs video.

~~Uh, ~~while,~~ uh,~~ if there, there's another, frame where you can see the theory material, then it's about the theory and it's not the coding. So for all the Codalongs video, you can see there's a Codalongs video here. And also when you click here, you come to YouTube and you can watch my video.[00:02:00] 

And so we just found in readme of each lecture and in the exercises, there's a readme describing about the exercises and there's a exercise 0, 1 and 2, and where you will get the actual exercises. And here you can, you will have a glossary. You will have theory questions and you will have,~~ uh, Uh, ~~practical questions,~~ uh,~~ for each of them.

So note, there's also labs in this course, but they're only available for those enrolled in this course and can be found in your learning management system, your LMS. So go and look there if you're enrolled in this course to find the labs. So they're not available public for everyone. So the tech stack that we'll go through,~~ uh,~~ in this course is that, of course, we'll work with Python.

~~So, ~~And in Python, we'll work with UV, VNV. So this is the virtual [00:03:00] environment,~~ uh,~~ and we'll go into the fundamentals of Python. We'll go into OOP, object oriented programming. And we'll go into Pandas for data processing for reading files into something called data frames and series. You will see what that is later on.

And we'll clean the data. We'll work with Visual Studio Code. And Visual Studio Code is an IDE. It's an integrated development environment where you'll be able to code and you will see how it works. How good it is for,~~ uh,~~ helping you to,~~ uh,~~ code in Python and we'll work with Git. ~~Uh, ~~it's,~~ uh,~~ and if you're in Windows, you work with Git Bash in Mac, you will work with the Git in your,~~ uh,~~ normal terminal, but you still need to install it.

~~Uh, ~~and you will work in Linux. You also will work in your normal terminal, but in Windows it's Git Bash. ~~Uh, ~~and in,~~ uh,~~ Git, you use it for version controlling locally. ~~Uh, ~~so after your version control locally, you go into, [00:04:00] you push it into GitHub.~~ Uh, ~~so here you will store the Git repository and you'll version control on GitHub.

And in this course we'll only work with the main branch. So ~~you, ~~you will learn,~~ uh,~~ some concepts like, ~~uh. Uh, ~~or ~~you, ~~you should have learned some concepts with,~~ uh, uh, ~~cloning with,~~ uh,~~ pull and with push and what that means. ~~Uh, ~~so ~~we, ~~ we will have a lecture on the Git and GitHub, how to set it up in case you haven't,~~ uh,~~ studied Git and GI Hub before.

But, ~~uh. Uh, ~~you probably have,~~ uh,~~ when you're taking, at least when you're enrolled in this course,~~ uh,~~ if you're taking it,~~ uh,~~ a standalone,~~ uh,~~ in,~~ uh, um, ~~online, then maybe you don't have a Git and GitHub. So it's good to,~~ uh,~~ to look into this,~~ uh,~~ material. So it's a zero free,~~ uh,~~ lecture, I think,~~ um,~~ you will see,~~ uh,~~ see where I'll go into how to install and set up Git and GitHub and,~~ uh,~~ Try to make a repository.

Yes, and we will work with bash, the CLI. So it's important to learn how to learn and [00:05:00] master using the terminal. And because you are not always having the GUI graphical user interface always. So when we're moving on to some study technique tips,~~ uh,~~ so when you're studying, it's good to,~~ uh,~~ have,~~ uh,~~ have some idea and how you should study for being more efficient and,~~ uh,~~ learn more.

~~Uh, ~~and how do you do it in,~~ uh,~~ in relation with the,~~ uh,~~ the content in this course and how it's structured. So basically we have,~~ uh,~~ so I usually work with,~~ uh,~~ an overview picture. So you have an overview for some glossary and which you can see from,~~ uh,~~ from the exercises. So go in there and work with the glossary.

~~Uh, ~~you can use LLM of course for the glossaries, but don't copy it. Instead write out what it means. So there's something called muscle memory. So the more you write out, the more you train your muscle memory to remember what it is,~~ uh,~~ the glossary. And same with the coding. Very important to write it [00:06:00] out.

Type it. And then,~~ uh,~~ afterwards there, there's a videos. ~~Uh, ~~so this is a video and you'll have several more videos. And here you can,~~ uh,~~ for the code alongs videos, you pause and code along. So you are coding quite fast, so you just pause it and you code and you type out the code. And don't copy paste there.

There is,~~ uh,~~ in the resources,~~ uh,~~ so that,~~ uh,~~ there in the GitHub link there, there is,~~ um, uh, ~~the code. But,~~ uh,~~ don't copy paste it. Instead, watch it several times and pause and code it because ~~it's in, ~~it's in the muscle memory and you need to train it up and also test it out. So try changing the code and see what happens.

So you get the instant feedback and also think about what will happen when you're coding it. So the video, very important part of this course structuring. And then if you are enrolled in this class, go into the class and discuss with your classmates. bring questions to the class, to the teacher, bring it to your classmates, [00:07:00] discuss.

So your classmates are your learning resources. So they are helping you to succeed and you're helping them to succeed. And afterwards, when you all go out to industry, they are your teammates, your colleagues in the future. So we also have practical exercises. So after, after the class, you go back to video.

To work when you're working with the exercises, you can go back to the videos to learn more,~~ uh,~~ concepts, and you can check with LLM of course,~~ uh,~~ such as chat, pt,~~ uh,~~ or,~~ uh,~~ Claude or ~~uh. ~~A Gemini or some similar,~~ uh,~~ l and m,~~ uh,~~ which,~~ uh,~~ you want to choose. ~~Uh, ~~and you can check the resources for extra,~~ uh,~~ extra learning materials.

~~Uh, ~~but,~~ uh,~~ work with the practical exercises and,~~ uh,~~ try to learn them. ~~Uh, ~~so you don't need to do all of them, but,~~ uh,~~ do some,~~ do,~~ do most of them and they will help you practice. And then there's also the resources, as I said,~~ uh,~~ those,~~ uh,~~ there might be [00:08:00] many resources that I link. So skim through them. You don't need to learn them exactly.

~~Uh, ~~and one more thing is,~~ uh,~~ I want to say in the study technique is that you should,~~ uh,~~ when you're working with LLM, chat with it and use it as a study buddy. So learn from,~~ uh,~~ from the LLM. And so if you have questions,~~ uh,~~ just ask them, ask it to clarify, and it will do it for you. And,~~ uh,~~ many times it is correct, but many times it's not correct.

~~Uh, ~~and if it's not correct, you can actually, you can check it out in the code and see if you get the result that this meant. And you can always ask it for more details. So use it as study buddy. ~~Uh, ~~yes. And then we come into the next lecture and then this,~~ uh,~~ this cycle starts again or this flow starts again and,~~ uh,~~ and so on and so forth.

~~So, uh, you, ~~you keep this in mind and,~~ uh,~~ and,~~ uh,~~ have this as, it's just a few study techniques,~~ uh,~~ tips. There's,~~ uh,~~ many more, and you should develop your own,~~ uh,~~ study techniques that,~~ uh,~~ that works best for you. But this is,~~ uh,~~ one [00:09:00] way to work with,~~ uh,~~ the structure of this course. So thank you for watching this video and,~~ uh,~~ I will see you in the next video where we'll go more into detail of where you find the different parts in the GitHub repository.

So thank you. Bye.
