# SQL analytics course with DuckDB - course structure

[00:00:00] Hello and welcome to this video where we'll go through the core structure of this SKL analytics course with ddb. Here I will show you where you can find different types of materials and what the material mean and how you can navigate around this course. And going through a little bit of, the tech stack and a little bit of study system. ~~How would you, ~~how could you approach learning using the video lectures, using the code, using the exercises, using glossary, et cetera? ~~Some. ~~Techniques for improving your learning. Of course, you don't need to follow it exactly, but it could be some tips and tricks that may help or may not help you.

But listen, that will be really nice. We'll navigate through ~~our, ~~the GitHub repository as well, where all the materials are in. This will ~~be very, it'll ~~set the very foundation for your learning in this course. Stay tuned and don't skip this lecture.

**Kokchun Giang-1:** how is this [00:01:00] SQL for data analytics that DB course structured? This is what this lecture is about. We will go through the slides here to see some overview and then we'll jump into the actual course repository, which you will have in the course in the link description as well for this YouTube video.

. Everything can be found in the course GitHub repository. ~~This is how it works. Everything is there. ~~Here you can see what we have. We have. Lectures from zero, zero to 19, maybe some more, I'm not sure yet. There could be ~~some, ~~some slight differences, but this is the main content in GitHub repository.

You can see here zero, zero intro and zero one core structure, zero two, set up tb, et cetera. And here you can see inside of each of these lectures there are read mes. And inside of this Read mes there are usually videos, video [00:02:00] content. It's a link to YouTube you can click on it and you will jump into YouTube.

Videos they are found in Read Me of each lecture, and then we have exercises. . In the exercise folder, ~~you have this, ~~you have a read me that describes this folder, and you have different exercises. And the exercises, basically, they ~~con ~~contain theory, practice, and the glossary. Usually, like I always include glossary that you learn the, the terminology of~~ of all ~~the.

Course ~~the content ~~because the terminology is very important when you are reading materials elsewhere or when you are communicating, you want to be able to communicate with the terminology that people in this field uses, ? That is the idea. And here's an example folder. For example, zero seven grouping data.

And you can see there is a data folder where you have for example, CSV file that [00:03:00] we're going to ingest or some other data. And then SKL folder where I put all the ~~scripts all the scale ~~scripts that I prepared in for this lecture. Which I also cover ~~in the, ~~in the videos. If there is something in the videos that you see like oh, I misspelled this, or.

It doesn't work for me. Then you can always take a look into the course repository and find the SQL scripts there, and you can see that you're typed correctly or you can copy paste it. Usually you shouldn't copy paste, but for some very, very repetitive code, for example, inserting a lot of values, then feel free to copy paste because I want you to type it out.

That when you're typing it out, you will gain muscle memory and you will learn the content better. ~~Feel, ~~make sure to like, post the video, type it out, and then continue. And also try out different variations of your code to see that it works. And usually ~~I, ~~if I have slides, also like theory concepts, then I have the slides [00:04:00] here as well.

Slides to PDF. This is the data folder. This is the SQL scripts folder. . A little bit about the tech stack or technology stack for this course. We'll focus on Duck DB of course. ~~Data SKL, duck, ~~duck DB CLI is the command line interface. We'll use s scale scripts which will run inside of local ui.

This is quite new to ddb. It's from before the summer this year it came out. ~~We have. ~~We work with Git and GitHub. I know that version control through Git, it's not same as GitHub, but with version control through Git. And we have GitHub for our repositories where ~~we'll have ~~you will store the code there.

If you follow me ~~in ~~in live courses, ~~in live course, ~~you should do that. And also if you're following me, online only. Then you should do that as well because it's very good ~~to store ~~to version control. Here we'll also work with the terminal, [00:05:00] Bash, CLI or ~~it could be like Kit Bash, ~~it could be like, said Shell in Mac, or it could be bash in Urban to, or Linux.

~~I, ~~I just call it Bash, CLI, but basically it's, yeah. ~~Term ~~term terminal. , If you're Windows, you should definitely use Git Bash and not PowerShell or~~ A ~~CMD. We'll use visual Studio Code, but if you want another editor ~~or ~~it's fine. But the Visual Studio Code I will be ~~used ~~at least.

This is the IDE Integrated Development Environment. And we'll use Python to connect to D db. We'll in ~~the ~~Python we'll use ~~UV ~~virtual environment, ~~we'll pi, ~~we'll connect Python to Duct DB and we'll use Duct DB to get with Pandas to do exploratory data analysis, data cleaning. ~~It will give, ~~when you combine these two, you will get superpowers.

That will be very interesting in the end of this course. . A few study technique tips or learning system tips when you [00:06:00] are studying with me. And also it works if you're studying online. As you can see, I have videos for all my contents, in this course. ~~What you should do is to.~~

Get an overview before, you take a look into the exercises. I have the glossary, just search them up ~~and ~~and read about them that you get the overview. Type out them in for example, Excel or you could have a normal notebook and type them out. And try to summarize yourself you can take help of LLM, but you should never copy it because~~ you, ~~you shouldn't take shortcuts for your learning, ?

Here~~ we have, ~~I have the videos. What you can do is that you can pause and code along. You can type out the code, don't copy paste. However you can of course copy paste those that are very repetitive. For example, ~~I have ~~inserting a lot of values. Then there's no need to type them out because that will be painful for the fingers.

Watch several times. You can always go back and [00:07:00] watch. You can pause code along. Watch concepts and like search concepts up elsewhere and pause and go back, et cetera. This you should do before you come to class. When you come to class, you should discuss with your classmates. You should bring questions to class.

This way you will be more. Engaged and changed from a passive learner to a more active learner. And when you are discussing with your classmates, then you will gain the social aspect of learning as well as we are social creatures. It's good to ~~like. ~~Share knowledge with each other, and you will get ~~like ~~different perspective from different people, ?

And also, when you are sharing your knowledge or teaching, it will make sure that you have organized it yourself in your brain that it's easier for you to actually understand and grasp the concepts. Because if you cannot explain it, then maybe ~~it, ~~it's because you don't fully understand the concepts [00:08:00] yourself.

, Go back after the class. Go back to the video. You can check with LLM and you can check the resources, and you can do the practical exercises. You do practical exercises and you feel like, ah, there's something I don't understand. You can go back to video to watch. You can check with LLM. You can check all the resources.

However, make sure that you are trying yourself ~~to ~~to solve the exercises. And then afterwards, there's the ~~resources ~~additional resources ~~that, ~~that I link. ~~You can usually, ~~you can skim through them and there's also additional exercises that I link that you can skim through. And then when this is done, you will go on for the next lecture and it will start again with, oh, you take a look into the glossary.

Video class exercises, et cetera. It's usually I divide it into three parts. There's. Before class. There's during class and there's after class. . Before, during, and after. These are very [00:09:00] important concepts. And the idea, it's similar, even if you don't have in, in class you can do similar thing, but you have the video instead.

You can always do things before video. ~~You can ~~you can do things after the video as well. And also the video you can watch several times. . Let's now move on to GitHub repository.

here I am in the GitHub repository and you can see here ~~D ~~DB SQL analytics course. And I will leave this in the description of course. And you can see, for example, you can go into querying data. And here you can see this is the read ~~mean ~~that you will go into by default when you click on it and you can see this is, a link to my, the YouTube for the theory part. And here's a link for the coding part. If you click on this one, you'll come into YouTube like this. And here I will talk about the select statement. ? And~~ the, ~~for the theory part, I ~~use ~~usually use slides. Here you can see the slides.

~~And also for, ~~and then for the [00:10:00] coding part, I usually use the data. You can see here's data salaries, csv, and here's SQL scripts that you can use. That I use in the video lecture. You can go in, for example, one here, and you can copy the code ~~if ~~or watch it and type out ~~if ~~if your code doesn't work, for example.

And then we have exercises, and you can take a look into the exercise structure here. Exercise zero, for example. You can see introduction to SQL and you can see~~ yeah, here's an example of an ~~here's an exercise~~ practical exercise. Here's also a ~~practical exercise. And then we have theory exercises.

To understand the concepts and then we have glossaries. Here, when I said before that it's good to do the glossaries fast that you can get the feel of the terminology and ~~learn some ~~learn the language which will make it simpler to. Actually understand the lectures and to understand other materials within this field, and also be able to [00:11:00] communicate using ~~this ~~this words.

Don't skip the glossaries. . That was that, and I will also say that yeah, you can. Of course clone. You can of course start this repository. You can fork it or you can clone it that you have it locally as well. , And also in the end here, I have some. Plan. And this plan is for a six week course, but maybe I will teach this for five weeks course or a four weeks course.

And then I, we cannot follow this exactly. Instead, ~~I will do some, ~~I will pick out things that is most relevant for that course. However, if you follow me online, then you can see that this could be ~~a, ~~a way to follow this course. Here you can see which lectures are covered within which weeks, and here you have the exercises.

However, the lab is not available for everyone. Online instead is only available for those that are taking this course. ~~Taking this course IRL. ~~In real life? [00:12:00] Yes. ~~Then ~~then you will have the lab available in your learning management system. , That was what I wanted to show you

So in this video we have gone through the GitHub repository where you could see the course materials, and we have gone through. How you could study, so the study system and basically the core structure so that you learn how this course is structured with all the materials there, with lectures, with code with the read mes that have links to video material.

So I hope that this was helpful for you and that you, feel that you have gotten some introduction to how this course is structured. So now when you are studying this course, I, I recommend that you go into the GitLab repository and make sure that you you, you familiarize yourself there. So I hope that this was helpful for you.

So thank you and see you in the next video. Bye.
